# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Rock Paper Scissors Recognition

This project aims to develop an image classification system to identify hand images showing the symbols of rock, paper, or scissors in the "Rock Paper Scissors" game using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This system will be able to understand and distinguish between these images, contributing to understanding image recognition and the use of CNNs in the context of gaming applications. Additionally, this project is also one of the prerequisites for passing the "Learn Machine Learning for Beginners" course at Dicoding, demonstrating the practical application of machine learning concepts in real-world scenarios.
